        <h1>Lucas Magnana</h1>
        <p>Deep learning research engineer</p>
        <p class="bio">I completed my PhD at INSA Lyon in February 2024. Since then, I have been working as a research engineer at INRIA, focusing on large language models. The team I'm working in investigates the security of neural networks, particularly the identification of model vulnerabilities, the design and evaluation of attacks, and the analysis of sensitive data leakage risks.</p>

      <h1>Skills &amp; Tools</h1>
      <p>I started coding in middle school and continued to refine my skills throughout my scholar and professional journey. I am now able to develop in Python, Java, and C++. I chose to specialize in artificial intelligence during the last year of my master's program, and I've been exploring and applying the many dimensions of this this exciting research domain ever since.</p>

                <li>Established through a collaboration between INRIA, CNIL, PEReN, and ANSSI, PANAME (Privacy Auditing of AI Models) aims to develop a standardized library for auditing model privacy. The objective is to enable organizations training models on sensitive data to easily conduct attacks and evaluate associated privacy risks.</li>
                <li>Together with another research engineer, I am responsible for developing the LLM module of the library. This includes designing model wrappers, implementing privacy attacks, and producing example scripts as well as unit and functional tests.</li>

                <li>My work investigates sensitive data leakage and adversarial vulnerabilities in LLMs, with a particular focus on medical use cases.</li>
                <li>We first developed a Privacy-Preserving Language Modeling (PPLM) training strategy designed to prevent models from learning both direct and indirect identifiers. For masked language models (MLMs), we prohibit the masking of identifiers during finetuning. For causal language models (CLMs), identifiers are replaced with padding tokens that are excluded from loss computation.</li>
                <li>Compared to both protected and unprotected baselines (models trained on anonymized data and models trained using differential privacy), our approach achieves the best utility-privacy trade-off.</li>
                <li class="link"><b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02407">Link of the preprint</a></b></li>
                <br>
                <li>Building on this, we explored multiple unlearning techniques, integrating PPLM into the reconstruction phase to improve the safety of models originally finetuned without privacy safeguards. Remarkably, retraining for only 10-20% of the original finetuning duration was sufficient to reach a utility-privacy trade-off comparable to fully protected training.</li>
                <li>We showed that retraining for only 10-20% of the original finetuning duration was sufficient to reach a utility-privacy trade-off comparable to fully protected finetuning.</li>

                <li>I imagined a new way of making a road segment attractive to cyclists using the dynamic properties of traffic lights.</li>
                <li>Using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and real vehicle counter data, I simulated a traffic light with green phases added specifically for cyclists. This trafic light allows cyclists to securely cross an intersection by separating their flows from the motorized vehicles.</li>
                <li>Naively added, these green phases for cyclists explode the waiting time of all vehicles at the intersection. </li>
                <li>I trained deep reinforcement learning agents to control this traffic light while minimizing vehicle waiting time. The agent trained using the Dueling Dual Deep Q-Network (3DQN) outperforms other tested traffic light control methods.</li>
